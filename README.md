- 👋 Hi, I’m @marimall
- 👀 I’m interested in writing python scripts of whatever usage as long as it is intesting or truly useful.
- 🌱 I’m always working on something but never the same. Life is too small to do the same stuff over and over!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever issue you might have that can challenge me or you really need it.
- 📫 How to reach me: Well good luck with that! Kidding of course. If you read my repositories readme's you can find my contact information!
