- 👋 Hi, I’m @marimall
- 👀 I’m interested in writing python scripts of whatever usage as long as it is intesting or truly useful.
- 🌱 I’m usually working on writing scripts that make my life easier when it comes to analysing data!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever issue you might have and I can help make your work a litlle less sufferable.
- 📫 How to reach me: Well good luck with that! Kidding of course. If you read my repositories readme's you can find my contact information!
